"What's in alpha blockers","virtually all alpha blockers including tamsulosin have been studied with mostly all antihypertensive classes and the aes are not higher in those pts on antihypertensives.",
"Issues with taking alpha blocker","I guess the issue is not the underlying comorbidity but whether the individual is taking medications for certain conditions that might interact with the alpha blocker",
"what can the OTC company do to warn consumers?","All that an OTC company can do is recommend medical consultation and make as convincing an argument as possible that it is i nthe consumers' interest. This is a lot for a package insert but it might need to be done.",
"the risk of tamsulosin hydrochloride?","the incremental risk of trying tamsulosin hydrochloride would be low, as long as there are no contraindications. Plus the label and insert should be demonstrated to drive increased physician interactions.",
"will the FDA be concerned about patients with preexcisting condition taking tamsulosin hydrochloride?","i think fda will be concerned about those men who have a concomitant condition with bph/luts who obtain partial relief from tamsulosin hydrochloride, are comfortable enough with the improvement not to bother getting checked out, and don't discuss their symptoms with their physician.",
"should patients should be pre screened for cancer prior to treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules?","screening for prostate cancer prostate cancer and bph frequently co-exist; therefore, patients should be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and at regular intervals afterwards",
"Can consumers use a dipstick properly?", "New studies will need to be conducted to demonstrate that consumers can interpret the readings and then whether they will behave accordingly.",
"Is a dipstick necessary?", "Dipstick is an unnecessary complication in this process with limited yield of what is called a medically relevant condition. Dipstick is not necessary and will overly complicate the OTC paradigm with a drug and a device.",
"Are there any benefits of including a dipstick", "The open discussion on this should determine if there is any subtype of potential users of alphaBs which might actually benefit from a dipstick test.",
"Any value in dipstick?","I see little value in enclosing a dipstick. It would detect very few of the co-morbid conditions of concern. Perhaps an algorithm of questions that include family history risk factors, symptoms and signs might work better to identify these other conditions of concern.",
"what study was done on unine analysis?","The data generated in the studies that included a urine dipstick at baseline will be pooled to understand how many men followed up on this advice and if they didn't what their rationale was not to seek advice.",
"Can consumers really use a dipstick?","If the AC and the FDA get stuck on dipsticks, though, what is missing is the ability to see that consumers can actually dip the stick and see the color changes for blood, glucose, etc, read those changes and then understand what the changes mean.",
"what conclusion on dipstick?","I believe we can put this to rest",

Do not provide contact information",
"Which ones do you think are the absolute contraindications that would put men in such danger that if consumers with those contraindications incorrectly self-selected to use tamsulosin hydrochloride these errors would kill the OTC program?","acute urinary retention, extreme difficulty passing even a drop of urine, any credible data that showed men with blood in their urine, discharge from their penis ignored the warnings.",

"are we including orthostatic hypotension rx label","underlying prostate cancer and other conditions,including orthostatic hypotension, may not occur in a large number of patients but they still exist and are noted in the rx label.",
"is 3 or 4 weeks enough data to be superior to medical opinion","given the relatively slow progression of some of the concerning underlying conditions, 3-4 weeks would not provide enough data to be superior to medical opinion...as much as i like data.",
"will men byt this product?","My assumption is that most men will recognize most of the listed symptoms if reflects a symptom that is bothersome to that individual. If men don't relate to any of the symptoms they are unlikely to purchase and use the product.",
"What should the label say?", "I would suggest that the label say 'enlarged prostate urinary symptom reliever' (or some such combination of words.",
"What are the urinary symptoms of prostatitis?", "By contrast, prostatitis has urinary symptoms, such as painful, difficult and/or frequent urinating.",
"What should be the discussion point?", "A discussion point for the group might be to focus on how the indication phrase can be consistent with tamsulosin hydrochloride AND support OTC limitations of use, if that's possible.",
"What are the issues with using the term ‘enlarged prostrate’?", "There are two problems with the 'enlarged prostate': 1) the size of the prostate does not correlate with symptoms severity as even small prostates can cause severe and bothersome symptoms 2) a consumer can not determine the size of an internal organ Taking into account that women experience LUTS as well a phrase that makes the product gender specific was needed in the purpose statement.",
"What is the purpose of saying ‘enlarged’?", "The purpose of saying 'enlarged' is simply to educate the pt about the most common source of the symptoms, not to encourage them to measure their own prostate size. Perhaps saying enlarged prostate as a possible cause of the symptom will encourage men to consider seeing a physician if sx are persistent.",
"What happened in the label comprehension study work?", "We did assess how well the study subjects understood the description of what prostate urinary symptoms could be.",
"What should be the wording on the label be?", "Prostate symptom reliever such as waking to go, going too often, weak stream or dribbling and starting and stopping.",

"Should ‘prostrate’ be included on the label?", "I still dont love the inclusion of the word 'prostate' in urinary symptom reliever as i think many consumers dot really get what the prostate is or how it might cause symptoms. That being said, if you provide descriptives, i think you are fine and can even leave the term prostate.",
"How would the consumer read the label?", "The consumer will be reading and trying to identify symptom by symptom.",
"Does company have any information regarding tamsulosin?","Company does not have information that would allow us to understand whether physicians are prescribing tamsulosin to men with mild symptoms. In the OTC-simulated studies we did collect data about the use of the AUA recommended lifestyle modification (responses were 'ever used', 'still using' and 'never used')",
"Should patients diagnose symptoms themselves?","I really dont think you want patients to diagnose themselves. you are selecting out patients with symptoms- because this is what patients understand- how they feel. you are going to select out patients who are bothered and that may impact effectiveness. That being said, patients are going to confuse some symptoms etc", 
"Can the consumer self-recognize the symptoms of the disease/condition?","If a person can select-in based on the label, can they (will they) appropriately select-out when they read the warnings, or when they self-observe no improvement (persistence of symptoms) or emergence of new symptoms or worsening of symptoms.", 
"Are the Consumers missing any underlying condition while treating themselves?","Much of the theme of my responses to this and other questions has been to go back to what aging men are doing in the real world. This needs to be carefully documented because my understanding is that, like women with OAB, they are silently coping with this common condition of aging and not taking it seriously enough to seek out professional advice. So the worries about missing an undiagnosed condition already exist without the presence of an OTC option for symptom relief.",
"Is self-recognition an issue?","Self-recognition of the symptoms of BPH is the important issue to be tested. My assumption is that most men will recognize most of the listed symptoms if reflects a symptom that is bothersome to that individual. If men don't relate to any of the symptoms they are unlikely to purchase and use the product.",
"Can self-selection be tested?","The ability of patients to accurately self-select could be tested, if you have not done this already, by getting a cohort of men of appropriate age, asking them to self-select by info on package insert and then have them evaluated by an expert (history only) who would use guideline recommendations and expert knowledge to determine best apporach for the specific subject patient. Then an analysis is done of the concordance between pt self-selection and selection by expert.", 
"What does OTCness mean?","OTCness may mean men with milder symptoms will self select an alphaB. However, if current practice shows men with milder symptoms often are part of the prescribing population, then that's helpful as mentioned in a prior comment, i remarked that his changes the benefit risk assessment, but likely modestly. These are not hard data to collect.",
"What is the difference between self-selection and self-diagnosis?","Self-selection is a broader term than self-diagnosis because it includes consideration of indications and warnings. Regarding the indication, company seems to have chosen a series of symptoms that people can self-identify. One difficulty in self-diagnosis may be found in the numbers that are part of the OTC indication - two or more for at least three months.", 
"What is the limitations of OTC label?","One of the occasional limitations of the OTC label is that the section on 'ask a doctor before use if' is separated from the section on 'stop use and ask a doctor if:...'",
"Would extra dosage of drugs be risky?","I think selection of subjects for the study and the study n work against this being as meaningful as hoped. Given the relatively slow progression of some of the concerning underlying conditions, 3-4 weeks would not provide enough data to be superior to medical opinion...as much as I like data."
