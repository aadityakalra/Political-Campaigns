Looks pretty good... Consider adding "heart failure" to causes (section 1) Consider adding "heart disease" to ask your doctor section (3) I do not see the relationship between diabetes and "extreme difficulty passing even a drop of urine" - Did you mean to put these together?
Thank you Khal Drogo for catching this typo. The last two bullets should be formatted as first level bullets, not sub-bullets. PLEASE SEE draft DFL & CIL in resources on home page for correct formatting.
I guess you're asking if we think the wording is reasonable. To ask if the label in the AUS is adequate, we would need to see the data on the SS/AUS study/ies and LCS. That said, under item 1, from a consumer standpoint the "if you think" phrase seems not quite on target. How would a consumer know within this warning whether or not they have these conditions, especially since the general term "urinary symptoms" is used. for warnings and action steps, more specificity is preferred, if possible. Warning 2: seems okay. Warning 3: Given my comments on warning 1, it does not feel as if these three warning are adequately integrated. ...just to spur discussion, here's an attempt at what I mean: Urinary symptoms can also be caused by: (insert list in warning 1) These conditions may be associated with symptoms such as: (insert list in warning 3) ...then put warning 2 as a "Specialty Warning" as the top of the warnings, such as: Urinary Retention Warning: if you cannot urinate at all and have severe bladder pain, get medical help right away.
retention can be silent as well so the pain should be segregated i.e. they dont always occur together
Do you have suggestions as to how the urinary retention warning language might read to capture this concept?
..if you cannot urinate at all with ot without severe bladder pain, get medical help right away.
These protective maneuvers are inadequate
Do you have recommendations as to why they are inadequate and how to optimize them?
I am having a hard time getting my arms around this. You are basically asking patients to "diagnose" themselves here with item #1 and frankly I think that is really not the best way to go. Patients cant tell if they have diabetes, bladder/prostate cancer or even an infection. Seems like if you are telling patients this, you really have a problem getting to an OTC state
The purpose of this part of the label is to alert consumers that they might have a more serious condition that requires medical attention. This is a common element of many OTC drug labels and is intended to drive interaction with an HCP. It also has to conform with the codified requirements of Drug Facts Labeling on the outer carton which, despite best intentions, may not allow for optimal wording or formatting. So the wording can be optimized through iterative testing but the package insert can use additional, perhaps more complete, language to reinforce the DFL messages. Whether or not they are "adequate" to prevent inappropriate self-selection can really only be tested in a cohort of men that have those symptoms. This can be problematic compared to simple label compression in a general population.
Another problem is that the FDA generally won't accept testing of the CIL for self-selection purposes because it is not available at point of purchase.
That's appropriate. For this reason, some sponsors have designed Actual Use or Self-Selection studies that allow the consumer to take the product home and make so-called post-purchase deselection decisions. It can become complicated but studies have shown this will happen, especially when the consumer is confronted with a new and unique treatment option. Labelling may include language about returning the product for a full refund.
Create a Urinary Retention Alert, as follows. This is a potentially serious condition requiring immediate help, not unlike some hypersensivities/allergies. Warnings Allergy Alert: do not use if you are allergic to” > tamsulosin > sulfa drugs Urinary Retention Alert: if you cannot urinate at all and have severe bladder pain, get medical help right away. Urinary symptoms can also be caused by: > infection of the bladder or prostate > diabetes > prostate or bladder cancer If you think you might have one of these conditions, or liver or kidney disease, talk to your doctor before use. Dizziness, light-headedness, and fainting may occur. Do not drive or operate machinery until you know how this medicine affects you. To reduce possible dizziness always take this medicine after a meal and stand up slowly. Do not use: Ask a doctor before use if you have:
...formatting did not come out in the blog script being used. The last two lines each have the same bullets as teh draft DFL shard by company.
Can not see how a consumer will diagnose :"Urinary symptoms can also be caused by: infection of the bladder or prostate, diabetes, prostate or bladder cancer If you think you might have one of these conditions, or liver or kidney disease. Talk to your doctor before use." Did you conduct the study with consumers who have these conditions to see how they deselected or did you show that they spoke to a physician. Also if a patient is being treated with certain products such as diuretics would they deselect? Do you have data? You may wish to have/test a broad statement Not to use and talk to your doctor if you are taking any prescription products or are being treated for diabetes, heart conditions, high blood pressure, etc.
How would you view the label if company conducted label comprehension studies with hypothetical scenario questions addressing your concerns related to men who THINK THAT THEY MIGHT have a bladder or prostate infection, diabetes, prostate or bladder cancer? Liver and kidney disease are common warnings on approved OTC drug products so I would be surprised if FDA would call out those specific warnings for this product. I'm having trouble envisioning how company could conduct a self-selection study on men who don't know that they have bladder or prostate cancer or bladder or prostate infections but think they might. How do they find those populations to enroll them? These men are different from those who know they have these underlying conditions. Those men who know they have those conditions are already under the care of a physician because they have received a diagnosis and are probably being treated for them.
Well I like scenario questions, and I think as you know FDA has liked them in the past as well. The symptoms of early comorbidities would have to be validated to create the scenarios. I think however some info from a robust claims data bases would be helpful as I mentioned in over comments asking for types of studies needed.
Good point.
A consumer cannot know whether he has an infection, diabetes, prostate or bladder cancer, liver or kidney disease unless told by a doctor. I suggest the language be "If you have been told by your doctor that you have.......", do not use this product until you discuss it with your doctor.
